# Azure SRE Agent Workshop 🔧

**Deploy infrastructure, break it on purpose, and watch AI fix it.**

A hands-on workshop that teaches operations teams how the Azure SRE Agent detects, diagnoses, and remediates infrastructure faults across **Kubernetes and VM-based enterprise workloads**. You'll provision real infrastructure, deploy an application, introduce realistic failures, and observe the SRE Agent investigate and propose fixes via GitHub.

## Start here

New to the Azure SRE Agent? Read the shared concept layer first:

1. [What is the SRE Agent?](docs/00-what-is-sre-agent.md)
2. [Why use it?](docs/01-why-sre-agent.md)
3. [How it works](docs/02-how-it-works.md)

## Choose a track

| Track | Focus | Start |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **AKS / Cloud-Native** | Kubernetes workload identity, CosmosDB RBAC fault injection | [workshops/aks/](workshops/aks/README.md) |
| **VM / Enterprise Migration** | Windows Server + IIS, Bastion access, approval-gated remediation | [workshops/vm/](workshops/vm/README.md) |
| **App Service / PaaS** | .NET 10 shop on App Service (Linux) + Azure SQL, passwordless managed identity | [workshops/appservice/](workshops/appservice/README.md) |

Each track follows the same loop: **deploy from code → inject a realistic fault →
watch the agent investigate → apply controlled remediation → capture a postmortem.**

## Scenarios at a glance

- AKS scenarios: [workshops/aks/scenarios/INDEX.md](workshops/aks/scenarios/INDEX.md)
- VM scenarios: [workshops/vm/scenarios/INDEX.md](workshops/vm/scenarios/INDEX.md)

## 💰 Cost Estimate

This workshop runs on Azure resources that incur real costs. The following estimate assumes the full ~3–4 hour workshop:

| Resource | Cost/Hour | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| AKS (2× Standard_DS2_v2 nodes) | ~$0.25 | Largest cost; note: nodes run during entire workshop |
| CosmosDB (serverless) | ~$0.05 | Minimal RUs for a workshop scenario |
| Log Analytics + App Insights | ~$0.10 | Standard monitoring pricing |
| SRE Agent | ~$0.50 | Depends on model provider and investigation volume |
| **Total** | **~$1.00/hr** | ~$4–6 for full workshop |

**Budget recommendation: Set aside $10 to be safe.** Remember to run the **Cleanup** module when done—resources still incur costs when left running.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Azure subscription with **Contributor** access
- Azure CLI and `kubectl` installed
- GitHub account (you'll fork this repo)
- Supported region: **East US 2**, **Sweden Central**, or **Australia East**
- Outbound network access to `*.azuresre.ai` (SRE Agent access)

### Clone & Begin

```bash
# 1. Fork this repository on GitHub
#    (Go to https://github.com/Azure/sre-agent-workshop and click "Fork")

# 2. Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sre-agent-workshop.git
cd sre-agent-workshop

# 3. Read the shared concept layer, then pick a track
cat docs/00-what-is-sre-agent.md

# 4. Follow your track's walkthrough
cat workshops/aks/README.md   # or: cat workshops/vm/README.md
```

Then follow each module in order. Each one builds on the previous.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Regions
The Azure SRE Agent is available in **East US 2**, **Sweden Central**, and **Australia East**. Choose one of these when provisioning your workshop environment.

### Network Requirements
- Your network must allow outbound HTTPS to `*.azuresre.ai`
- If behind a corporate proxy, ensure it doesn't block this domain

### AKS Accessibility
The AKS cluster must be public (not private). The SRE Agent needs network access to query cluster logs and metrics.

### Cleanup is Critical
Resources like AKS and CosmosDB incur hourly costs even if idle. **Always run the Cleanup module** to delete resources when done. A forgotten cluster can cost $20–30 overnight.

### Production Use
This workshop is designed for learning. Do not use these patterns (especially Autonomous autonomy level) in production without additional controls, approval gates, and testing.
